## Overeview
This project allows you sketch by mouse movement. <br>
I created it as a assignment from THE ODIN PROJECT. I refered some codes from my previous project 'Random-boxes'(https://github.com/gucchunchun/Radnom-boxes.git)<br>



## Features
- Drawing with a brush tool
- Selectable pen color
- Background color customization
- Adjustable brush size (sketch box size)
- Eraser tool

## What I learn
- customise input element (type: color/range)
- shape element with masking
